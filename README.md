# SimpleCV

This repos demonstrates some of the features of the [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/) Python module (a simplified binding to the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) library) and its in the field of vision analysis, specifically the detection of 'registration marks' on a sheet of paper and tracking a laser spot around this.

The original material was presented at the April Meeting of the Toronto, Canada *Python Meetup* group [see](http://www.meetup.com/Python-Toronto/events/229959373/).  This original material is archived on the Meetup WWW site including the 20 slide presentation and videos referenced in it.

Also included in this repo is the use of the [PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) module for detection of 'taps' using a standard teleconferencing headset microphone plugged into a PC's jack socket.

Future plans include the detection of audio and video events together and taking actions based upon these.
